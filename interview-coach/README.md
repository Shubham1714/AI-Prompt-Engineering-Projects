# AI Interview Coach

## Overview
This project explores how AI can help job seekers practice and refine their interview answers. The goal was to design prompts that simulate real interview scenarios.

## The Challenge
Many candidates struggle with articulating their responses in interviews. AI can assist by providing constructive feedback and improving clarity.

## Prompt Design
Final optimized prompt:
"Simulate a job interview for a [Job Title] position. Ask one question at a time, wait for my response, then provide feedback on clarity, confidence, and improvement suggestions."

## Process & Iterations
- **Initial Prompt:** AI asked too many questions at once.
- **Iteration 1:** Adjusted the format to make AI wait for responses.
- **Final Version:** AI now gives structured feedback after each answer.

## Sample Output
**Question:**  
*"Can you tell me about yourself?"*  

**Candidate Response:**  
*"I have worked in steel detailing for six years and have recently transitioned into AI prompt engineering."*  

**AI Feedback:**  
*"Good introduction, but add a specific strength and a brief success story to make it more compelling."*

## Reflection
This project highlighted how AI can be used as an interactive coaching tool to improve job interview performance.
